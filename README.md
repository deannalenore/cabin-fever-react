# Project Title
Cabin Fever: The Quarantine Match Game

# Description
Cabin Fever is a match game that enables a single player to uncover cards and create matches of different locations around the world. 

# Motivation
The inspiration behind Cabin Fever centered around the current global pandemic that is keeping people social distanced, causing cancelled events and postponed travel plans. Cabin Fever seeks to give users a fun, engaging way to see the world while in quarantine and to become inspired to make long-awaited travel plans when the world returns to some semblance of normalcy. 

# Built With
- React
- Redux
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How it Works
Cabin Fever is a single-player game that presents three cards with hidden images to be revealed during the game. The player will click on a single card to reveal an image, and then select a second card to determine if there is a match. If three matches are found in five attempts, an alert will display, indicating that the player has won. If three matches are not made, an alert will display, stating that three matches were not made and offer the player an opportunity to try again. If the player clicks the "Try Again" button, the game will start over. The number of matches in each game are tabulated at the top of the screen. Cards are revealed using CSS animation.
