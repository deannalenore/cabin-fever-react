# Project Title
Cabin Fever: The Quarantine Match Game

# Description
Cabin Fever is a match game that enables a single player to uncover cards and create matches of different locations around the world. 

# Motivation
The inspiration behind Cabin Fever centered around the current global pandemic that is keeping people social distanced, causing cancelled events and postponed travel plans. Cabin Fever seeks to give users a fun, engaging way to see the world while in quarantine and to become inspired to make long-awaited travel plans when the world returns to some semblance of normalcy.
